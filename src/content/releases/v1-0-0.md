Welcome to MyDinero! This is our initial release, built from the ground up based on what users actually want in an expense tracker.

## Why We Built This

We analyzed over 200 reviews from the top expense tracking apps and found a clear pattern: users want simplicity, privacy, and features that actually matter. No bank connections. No complexity. Just a clean way to track spending.

## What's Included

MyDinero 1.0 includes everything you need to take control of your finances:

- **3-Tap Entry**: Add expenses in seconds with our intuitive calculator interface
- **Smart Categories**: Organize with categories AND subcategories (Food → Groceries, Restaurants, Coffee)
- **Recurring Transactions**: Set up Netflix, rent, and subscriptions once and forget about them
- **Budget Alerts**: Know when you're approaching your limits with notifications at 80% and 100%
- **Multiple Accounts**: Track cash, credit cards, and savings separately
- **Daily Totals**: See exactly what you spent each day without doing math
- **iCloud Sync**: Your data syncs automatically across iPhone and iPad

## Privacy First

No bank connections. No email required. No data collection. Your finances stay on your devices and in your iCloud — that's it.
